Implemented a distributed file system
Server is built as a stand-alone UDP-based server. It should wait for a message and then process the message as need be, replying to the given client.
Each directory has an inode, and points to one or more data blocks that contain directory entries. Each directory entry should be simple, and consist of 32 bytes: a name and an inode number pair.
